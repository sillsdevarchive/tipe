# CHAPTER & VERSE
# Parameters that cover varous aspects of formating of chapter and verse layout
[[ChapterVerse]]

# SHORT BOOK CHAPTER OMIT
# If a book consists of a single chapter it is often desirable to not have a
# chapter number marking the beginning of the book.  If set "true" this will
# insert a command in the control file to prevent ptx2pdf from inserting the
# chapter number.
#  Choices: (true | false) - Default = true
shortBookChapterOmit        = 'true'

# OMIT ALL CHAPTER NUMBERS
# Omit the chapter numbers of the book. (Often used for one-chapter books.  If
# set to true, this will override the Short Book Chapter Omit setting above and
# will take all the chapter numbers out of all books. (I think)
#  Choices: (true | false) - Default = false
omitAllChapterNumbers       = 'false'

# MARGINAL VERSES
# To use marginal verses (flying verse numbers) set this to 'true'.
#  Choices: (true | false) - Default = false
useMarginalVerses           = 'false'

# OMIT VERSE NUMBER ONE
# Setting this to 'true' will prevent verse number 1 from being displayed which
# is normally good for in-line verse formated Bibles that use drop chapter
# numbers.
#  Choices: (true | false) - Default = true
omitVerseNumberOne          = 'true'

# CHAPTER VERSE SEPARATOR
# Change the default c/v separator character or adjust the space by adding some
# extra code.  For example, to kern the space between the separator character
# you could enter: "\kern.02em:\kern.02em".  This setting primary affects the
# header reference.
#   Default = ":"
chapterVerseSeparator       = ':'

# AFTER VERSE SPACE FACTOR
# You may need a little extra space following the verse numbers.  This will add
# space in this context with a factore that is related to the \FontSizeUnit,
# this way it scales with the text.  This can be used with both in-line and
# marginal verse layouts.
#   Default = 2
afterVerseSpaceFactor       = 2

# AFTER CHAPTER SPACE FACTOR
# You may need a little extra space following the Chapter numbers.  This will
# add space in this context with a factore that is related to the \FontSizeUnit,
# this way it scales with the text.  This can be used with both in-line and
# marginal verse layouts.
#   Default = 3
afterChapterSpaceFactor     = 3

# ADORN VERSE NUMBER SETTING
# By placing a properly formated setting in this field, TeX will place a verse
# adornment like parenthesis or anything else you may want to specify.  An
# example for parenthesis would be '(#1)' whereas the #1 is the verse number
# variable.  That must be there for the verse number to appear.  If you leave it
# blank no settings will be output to the settings file.
#   Default = nothing
adornVerseSetting           = ''

# CHAPTER LABEL
# The default for display of chapter number is the drop chapter number style.
# To use a chapter "label" which will be inserted at the top of the first
# paragraph a \cl marker must be inserted before the first \c in the text.  To
# do this you will run the insert_chapter_label module.  The setting in this
# field will automatically be included with the \cl marker that is inserted in
# the text.
#
# Usage note:
# If \cl is entered once before chapter 1 (\c 1) it represents the text for
# "chapter" to be used throughout the current book.  If \cl is used after each
# individual chapter marker, it represents the particular text to be used for
# the display of the current chapter heading (usually done if numbers are being
# presented as words, not numerals).
#
# In order for the \cl to work and override the drop chapter number style, you
# must have a value inserted in this field.  If you only wish to have the number
# displayed in the label, centered above the text, you will need to insert a
# zero width space character (U+200B) in this field.  Then only the number will
# be inserted at runtime.
#   Default = Chapter

# verse format but there might be other situations where you may need it.  This
# is a contextual setting depending on how many columns are being used.  It will
# output both the \singlecolumnshift and \columnshift commands in the TeX
# settings file.  This is a usfmTex setting and is not part of the standard

# COLUMNGUTTERRULESKIP (mm)
# It may be necessary to push the top of the gutter rule down a few mm.  By
# setting the number to be greater than zero this will enable you to adjust

# Keep things simple please. Also, be aware that other ptxplus
# processes may use "piping" to move data internally. If that is

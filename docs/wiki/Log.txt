Today, after over three months of revision, with no production taking place, I'm calling this version (0.7.6) stable. Now this project goes into maintenance mode. Deployment of this version will break every previous project but the structure in place now should stand for some time to come.

This is the last version of ptxplus. A new branch will be made soon and development will pick up at that point on the next generation of this system.

There are some known problems in the GUI. I will try to log them. Some will never be fixed. Also, the map process probably does not work. With all the changes, there is no reason that it should. That will be looked at at some point and fixed. Over all, the core of the system seems stable and many features that have been shaky for a long time are very solid now.

Branched to stable in order to continue development on the default repository branch. Development will begin with writing specifications and descriptions of publishing components or objects as they will be referred to. The specifications and object descriptions can be found in the [[Specifications]] document.

Implemented a topical index process. It will take a csv file in the project source area and convert it to an sfm file in the Peripheral folder. That is still a command line process at this point. It goes like: ptxplus make_topic_index

Once the sfm file is made it can be processed like other kinds of peripheral material with the view command. This needs to be automated at some point. However, we don't want it to blow away existing data.

Added 2 experimental formating scripts today. One which strips out the footnotes and cross references and puts them in a separate peripheral file. A second script which removes footnotes and cross refs too and also takes out the verse numbers so that the text can be read without all the extra-Biblical references.

These are only drafts and more work needs to be done on them to make them usable in a production environment.

Yesterday, while IMing with Martin I stumbled on zim, a wiki application. I've come to find this to be the most efficient way to convey information in the system so I will be implementing it in all aspects of the system. If a better wiki management program comes along I can always easily change. Right now the only additional thing I would like zim to do for me is spell checking.

So it is not lost, this is a solution that Martin gave me to change the case on file names within Makefile. The situation is this. You have a file name like $(1).log which expands to name.log. However, you need it to be NAME.log for things to work right. With a little Perl code you can do like this:

'''
$(shell perl -e 'print uc("$(1)")').log
'''

We used this for a while in the code but due to some changes we no longer needed it. It is here for possible future use.

**20080822**
To pull info out of fonts we can use ftinfo (part of fttools package) and cut. This line will deliver a list of fonts from a folder with their name and typeface:

'''
ftinfo -n *.ttf | cut -d : -f 1,5
'''

ftinfo delivers a big list of stuff but then cut takes out all the stuff we don't want.

**20080815**
To build the package do this:

1) Starting in the project directory (ptxplus) run:
	ln -s debian-src debian

2) If you don't have it, install dch with:
	sudo apt-get install dch

3) Run:
	dch -n

4) To build, you may need to install the pbuilder package:
	sudo apt-get install pbuilder
	then
	pbuilder --create
This will take a while as it has to download and install a lot of stuff
You may need to also install the debhelper package if pbuilder fails.

'''
Finally:
pdebuild --debbuildopts -I --logfile
'''

If you can't find the .deb file look in /var/cache/pbuilder/results

History: (09:26:05 AM) uniscript: I'm thinking of calling the package xetex-ptxplus

**20080810**
Kokou has been officially named ptx-plus. It has now been separated from the project file work area and will be packaged and will have dependencies on XeTeX and a bunch of other packages. Right now, while under development, we have to install manually and that take a couple operations:

Edit the .profile file
	sudo gedit ~/.profile
Add this to the end:
	export PTXPLUS_BASE=/home/dennis/Projects/ptxplus

or, to do it auto-magically use:
	PTXPLUS_BASE=/home/dennis/Projects/ptxplus >>  ~/.profile

(Note: Adjust the paths if your system is different)
Next time you reboot the new settings will be there.

To get it working on the current login (terminal) use:
	source ~/.profile

To see it use
	echo $PTXPLUS_BASE

To use it easier we need to link ptxplus (main program) to /usr/bin
	sudo ln -s /home/dennis/Projects/ptxplus/bin/ptxplus /usr/bin/ptxplus

That should do it.

To get rid of the settings from the system environment use:
	unset PTXPLUS_BASE

You may also need to go to /usr/local/bin and get rid of the link there to avoid confusion in the system. Use:
	sudo rm /usr/local/bin/ptxplus

**20080806**
It might have been this day when Martin first mentioned naming it ptx-plus

**20080401**
Kokou may be presented at CTC this fall by Martin in a 5 min. presentation. Much will need to be done to get the system in order and have it well documented. Right now Texinfo might be the way to go. Look at:

http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/

That way documentation could be generated both in static form and live on the web. More thought is needed.

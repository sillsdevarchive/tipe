# it may not work right with earlier versions.

# This is a unit test written by Tim Eves used to test the output from
# a master wordlist file against the individual files that created it.
# To use it copy this file into the Reports directory and use:
#        unit_test-make_master_wordlist wordlist-master.csv *-wordlist.csv

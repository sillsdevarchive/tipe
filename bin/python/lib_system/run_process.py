# This script facilitates the running of text processes on

# file and close it out when everything is done.

# Firstly, import all the standard Python modules we need for
# this process

import os, sys

# Next is a work around for an internal encoding problem. At
# some point the python scripts get confused and start seeing
# the world as ASCI. This messes everything up and give an
# error like:
#    UnicodeWarning: Unicode equal comparison failed to
#    convert both arguments to Unicode - interpreting them
#    as being unequal
# or
#    UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte
#    0xe2 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)
#
# Regardless of which one you get or perhaps some others,
# everything grinds to a halt. The following code seems to
# work around the problem:

# Turns out this is a real hack and we have tried to implement
# a real solution by adding an encoding setting in the ConfigObj()
# calls we make. That is where it has actually been breaking.
# I will comment this for now and it can be taken out later
# after testing show that this approch works.

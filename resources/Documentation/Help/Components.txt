====== Components ======

A book is made up of individual components. An example of a component is the verso (copyright) page, or an index. Each type of publication may have a different set, or potential set, of components than others. A Bible will have a content group that is made up of many components, whereas a simple dictionary may only have one. In this section we will divide up the information by publication types which are recognized by the system.

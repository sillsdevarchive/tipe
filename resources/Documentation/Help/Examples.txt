==== Role Your Own ====
Ptxplus is a system which helps you carry out and manage a publication project. It is not a magical piece of software that does it for you. This is why you get paid all that money to be a //"publishing specialist"//. :-) To get a feel for what you can do with ptxplus, the easiest way is to create a sample project and poke around. To get you started, here are some simple steps:

1) Create a folder on your drive where you would like to do your publishing work. It can be anywhere and it doesn't have to be just one place. Next create a folder in that folder with some silly name like "test".

2) Assuming you are in Nautilus, navigate to your new test folder, then right click and then **Scripts -> ptxplus**

3) In the ptxplus control panel, click **Project -> New**, then in the dialog type a test project name and click Open.

4) Next click **Project -> Open**, it should be located in your new project, if not, find it, then click Open.

5) You are now in your test "New Nameless Project". Check out the Config tab, that is the "DNA" of the publication. Also, look at the folders and files that ptxplus has created. Familiarize yourself with what is in them.

6) Now click on the **View-COVERFRONT.USFM** button. In a few seconds a PDF file should appear with a draft of your project's front cover.

7) As the file was just freshly generated it is still warm, so don't touch it yet. While you are waiting for it to cool, look around the project files again and see what has changed since you ran this first typesetting operation.

8) Next, in the Config tab find **Format -> Binding -> MATTER_NT.** Double click on the field and a small dialog will appear where you can change the setting. Initially, the setting will be "," (this indicates it is a list field). Replace this with "jas," (note the comma) and click **Apply**. Then click **Close**. In the main window click on the Reload Settings button. Now in the Component list (upper left), click the button and a list should appear of all the components that the system recognizes for this project. Click on **jas**. You are now ready to process the Book of James.

9) Click on the **Session** tab, then click on the View-jas button. A bunch of text will fly by in the session window then you will see the freshly created jas.usfm.pdf file. The source that created this PDF is a test file that is included with the system for testing purposes and was imported into the Source folder of the project when it found there was none there. Take a look at the PDF. Notice that it uses //"dumb"// quotes. Now close it and look for the error log window. There should have been some. Close that window and look at the project folder again and notice the changes that were made.

10) Now we will change the dumb quotes to smart ones. Go to the Config tab and under **ProjectText -> SourceText -> Features**, change **dumbQuotes**, **contractionMarkers** and **possessiveMarkers** all to "true". Next go to **System -> Processes** and add the "swap_quotes" process to the **textProcesses** list. (Remember to put a comma "," after it so ptxplus sees this field as a list.) Now run **View-jas** again and all the quote markers including contraction and possessive markers, should be changed to be //typesetter's quotes//.

There is much more that can be done with this data set but if we did it all then this wouldn't be a //quick start//, would it?

==== Example Project ====
Ptxplus also comes with an example project that can be used to test or demonstrate the system. Installation of the project is easily accessed through the ptxplus interface by clicking on Menu -> Help -> Example, or, in the terminal, type:

'''
	ptxplus example <path>
'''

If you do not enter a path ptxplus will deposit the example project in a folder called ptxplus-example in the current working folder.

The installation only takes a moment and when it is done you will need to open the project up in the ptxplus interface. In the menu click on File -> Open and then just navigate to the newly created project.

Have fun!

**[Note: Caution, this has not been tested in the Lucid version of ptxplus.]**

# This script handels the copying of text source files to the
# working directory. It is blind when it comes to encoding
# changes. Changing the encoding at copy time is seen more as
# a technique than a common practice. This is somewhat
# simplistic but should allow for more complex copy operations
# as it is developed further.

# History:
# 20080519 - djd - Initial draft
# 20080531 - djd - Changed to a class and moved to run through
#        the process_scripture_text.py script
# 20080627 - djd - Updated some of the initiation used tools
#        class to do this
# 20080731 - djd - Fixed a file name problem due to a system
#        file name change for periperal files.
# 20080821 - djd - Make changes to reflect the implementation
#        of flat file management (linear ouput processing)
# 20080826 - djd - Changed the copy command to be one that
#        comes from the project.conf file. This allows
#        us to customize it for encoding conversions.
# 20081020 - djd - Added a sanity check on the copy and fix
#        some bugs.
# 20081023 - djd - Refactored due to changes in project.conf
# 20081030 - djd - Added total dependence on log_manager.
#        This script will not run without it because
#        it handles all the parameters it needs.
# 20100622 - djd - Removed the reencodingRequired var which
#       changes the script to be encoding agnostic.

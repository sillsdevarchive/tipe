Welcome to the TeX Integrated Publishing Environment (TIPE a.k.a. ptxplus)

This file was made when a new project was created in this folder. It has no
purpose other than to tell you that the TIPE system has copied into this
folder a hidden configuration file which is the "DNA" for this publication.

The next step is to setup your project and go to work.  You can do that by
right-clicking in the folder and open up TIPE.  Once your project is underway
you can delete this file.

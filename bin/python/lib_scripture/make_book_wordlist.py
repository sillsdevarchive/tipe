# Generate a word list for the current book being processed.
# This will parse the book and generate a word list and put
# it in the Reports folder.

# History:
# 20090130 - djd - Initial draft
# 20090204 - djd - Completed working first version. However,
#        There is a lot of potential with this process but
#        a lot of work needs to be done such as CSV output
#        on the book report files.
# 20090209 - djd - Completed optimization, works very fast
#        now. We may want to incorporate this in check_book
# 20090323 - djd - With Tim E's help we got the encoding
#        issues ironed out and added true CSV output.
# 20090326 - djd - Moved the process to strip out non-word
#        characters to the encoding manager so it can be
#        shared by other processes.
# 20090401 - djd - Added some better debugging to track
#        possible problems with encoding transformations.
#        Again, Tim E did pretty much all of it
# 20091009 - te - Reordered process and added piping so that
#         a common encoding conversion process could be
#        used rather than having two seperate processes.

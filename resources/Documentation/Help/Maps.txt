====== Managing Maps ======
The finer points of how to work with maps in ptxplus. Maps are really a part of the peripheral matter but since they require a significant amount of work they get their own page.

=== Summary ===
Producing a single map is a five step process.
1) Edit the map translation data file
2) Merge the map translation data with the map SVG template
3) Edit the resulting SVG map file
4) Create the PDF typeset page with the map on it.
5) Adjust the map position on the page (if necessary) and re-typeset

Once the individual maps have been produced and approved, they can be bound into one PDF file that is then delivered to the publisher. In addition to this, the color space information can be converted. The default color space is RGB but it can be easily converted to CMYK

=== Color Management ===
Some printers require CMYK color space for the color material you give them. As the maps are generated with Inkscape, RGB is the default and there is a separate process outside of Inkscape we use to convert them to CMYK.

###############################
This all needs to be rewritten...

The way to fulfill this requirement is to take the PDF that you generated with the system and import it in the Gimp. The Gimp does a good job of importing PDF files. Use about 300 dpi as your desired output resolution. You may use a higher resolution but beware that the output file size may get rather large. Once the import is done, use the Separate plugin to generate a CMYK file in the TIFF format. The specific file you need to convert may vary but if you are using the auto-map-generation process look for <map ID>-map-pre.pdf

The Separate plugin is included in an Ubuntu package called gimp-plugin-registry and icc-profiles. However, these packages do not come installed with a standard Gimp installation. You will need to install them if they are not already. (Remember to exit the Gimp first, then restart it when you are finished.) To install the gimp-plugin-registry and icc-profiles use the Synaptic package manager or, open a terminal and type the following line:

	sudo apt-get install gimp-plugin-registry icc-profiles

Use the Separate plugin (Image -> Separate -> Separate) to create a new image of the imported map. It will have four layers in it, one for each color. There are several settings in the dialog to be concerned with. These seem to work for most jobs:

'''
Source color space: sRGB IEC61966-2.1
	Check: Give priority to embedded profile
Destination color space: Fogra27L CMYK Coated Press
Rendering intent: Perceptual
	Check: Use BPC algorithm
	Check: Preserve pure black
'''

These settings should get the job done but you may want to adjust these settings if you are printing to non-coated paper.

Next, use the PDF export feature of the Separate plugin (Image -> Separate -> CMYK Tiff 2 PDF...)  to export the newly created layered CMYK file into a merged CYMK PDF file that will be used by the system to create the final set. As with the conversion process, there are some choices to make in the dialog. These seem to work:

CMYK Tiff Images: <mapID>-map-pre-CMYK.tif
Compression: JPEG 95% Quality
Resolution (dpi):
Delete Images...:
Start PDF Viewer...:


Next, in the terminal located in the Maps folder, use the "convert" utility, which is part of [[ImageMagick]] package, to embed your new CMYK TIFF file into a PDF file. The command line would be something  like this:

	convert m006-CMYK.tif m006-CMYK.pdf

Next, still in the terminal, link the new PDF files to the process directory with something like:

	cd ../Process
	ln -sf [[../Maps/m006-CMYK.pdf]] .

Now open up the MAPS.USFM file in your Text folder and edit the necessary lines so that it will now point to the new CMYK PDF files you have made. This will generate a new version of the MAPS.USFM.pdf file. Be sure to copy it into the deliverables folder and rename it to indicate that it contains content in the CMYK color space.

=== Map Templates ===
Currently there are 11 map templates to choose from. Here is a brief description of each one:

'''
m001 = Modern world
m002 = Ancient world
m003 = Exodus from Egypt
m004 = Conquest of Canaan
m005 = Kingdoms of Israel and Judah
m006 = Holy Land in the Time of Jesus Christ
m007 = Jerusalem in New Testament Times
m008 = Paul's Missionary Journeys
m009 = The Temple in the time of Jesus Christ
m010 = Seven Churches of Asia
m011 = The Temple Buildings
'''

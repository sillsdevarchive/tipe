====== Terminal Commands ======

Virtually everything ptxplus does actually happens with a terminal command. The ptxplus manager simply helps the user access the commands with a GUI. This page contains a listing of all the commands available to the user in the terminal. By using these commands a user could manage a publishing project completely from the command line. This feature is useful for those who suffer from //command-line separation anxiety//. :-)

The commands are listed below by category. To access them please remember to type //ptxplus //before each one. For example, to get this help system you would type:
	ptxplus help

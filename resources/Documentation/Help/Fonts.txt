====== Fonts ======

Tips on working with fonts in ptxplus and in general.

Graphite Rendering
To add Graphite rendering to your text you need to add a command to each of the fonts you are using. Something like this:

	\def\regular{"[../Fonts/CharisSIL/CharisSILR.ttf]/GR"}

The default rendering is ICU. However, a non-confirmed bug has been observed where some strings of text (complex Roman script) will cause [[XeTeX]] to crash. Adding graphite rendering seemed to fix this.

==== FRET ====
The FRET utility will help you to see just what is in your project font. You can install it by typing in your terminal:

	sudo apt-get install libfont-ttf-scripts-perl

Or, you can find the libfont-ttf-scripts-perl package in Synaptic if you have the SIL package repository installed. If not you will need to add it to your repository list. However, I'm not going to tell you how to do that because that should have happened during the install process. Check the installme file located in the root of your ptxplus system folder.

Once FRET is installed, in a terminal, go to the Font folder of your project and then to the exact font folder where you have the [[.ttf]] font file and type this command with your font name:

	fret -r fontName.ttf

This will generate a report of the font in a PDF file in the same directory. You can then go into that file and find out what Unicode characters are actually in the file. Apart from a utility like this, it can be hard to know exactly what is there because sometimes the system will use fall-back characters to fill in for missing ones in the font. That, as I'm sure you know, is not good on a publishing project.

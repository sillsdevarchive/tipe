# CUSTOM HYPHEN WORD LIST
# This is a simple list of words which contain hyphens
# that denote where the word can be broken at the end
# of a line. If not hyphen is used, then the word will
# pass into the final list and will not be broken by
# TeX when the line is set. This file can contain proper
# names too, any word that might vary from the normal
# rules that are set for this project.

# Please remove these comments and replace them with
# a list of one word per line.

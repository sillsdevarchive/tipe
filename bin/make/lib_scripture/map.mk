# map.mk

# This file provides build rules for building all peripheral material,
# front and back, that might go into a Scripture publication. The
# rules will be laid out so that it will allow total flexibility as
# to if matter will be placed in the front or back. For example,
# it would be possible to put the copyright page in the back of the
# publication if necessary even though that is normally not done.
# Where components will be placed will be determined by the user
# as they layout the order in the Binding section of the project.ini
# file. That information is used to auto-build the process_instructions.mk
# file. That is the file that drives this one.
#
# It is possible to pick out one component and focus on that. Several
# generic rules will be provided for that.

# History:

# 20080925 - djd - Initial draft version.
# 20090909 - te - Some debugging work was done to fix a problem
#		with a python script not being called. More needs
#		to be done on this and other make file scripts to
#		make them more concise in the way the exicute.
# 20090914 - djd - Removed some double dependency rules to simplify
#		the process. Also removed the dependency for
#		pdf generation. The process will fail if preprocessing
#		has not been done. The reason is that there is
#		a proceedure conflict between maps and books.
# 20090923 - djd - Added the link-maps command to make created linked
#		files easier.
# 20091201 - djd - Changed references for MAP_IDS to MATTER_MAPS to
#		reflect changes in the rest of the system
# 20100113 - djd - Added code for processing maps with seperate
#		style files
# 20100116 - djd - Did a virtual rewrite on the process. It is now
#		more consistant with the rest of the processes.
# 20100125 - djd - Added ability to process map graphic files
#		that have been created by an external process
# 20100202 - djd - Added auto CMYK conversion ability
# 20100615 - djd - Changed hard codded extions to vars

#		Rules for producing maps
##############################################################

# We'll do this similar to the peripheral process rules. First
# we will define a rule group for maps.

define map_rules

# If the CREATE_MAP var is set to 0 this will enable the
# first set of rules to be acted on which enable the automated
# creation of SVG maps based on templates in the library.
# Otherwise, there is a set of rules that enable the use of
# existing maps that are kept in the Source/Maps-ID folder.

# We're going to start the map build process like the Scripture
# process, that's why there's a MAP for the ID. The make_map_file.py
# script will see to it that there is a Maps folder and a csv
# file for this map. It takes care of the copy process. It should
# be able to do this and if it can't it should tell us why.

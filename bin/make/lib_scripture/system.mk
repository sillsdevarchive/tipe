# system.mk

# This file provides build rules for setting up system files.

# History:

# 20080403 - djd - Added header information
# 20080404 - djd - Removed front, mid and back matter stuff
# 20080406 - did - Added PROCESS_INSTRUCTIONS rule
# 20080407 - djd - Moved setup functions to this module
# 20080410 - djd - Changed some vars to more descriptive ones
# 20080429 - djd - Removed PY_SETTINGS var refs
# 20080502 - djd - Changed path to process_instructions.mk
# 20080504 - djd - Added a bulk copy rule for all admin files
# 20080514 - djd - Added support for 3 level projects
# 20080517 - djd - Removed rule for making process_instructions
#		This is now handled by make_new_project.py
# 20080627 - djd - Channeled some processes through the system
#		processing command
# 20080726 - djd - Moved folder create rules to this file
# 20080807 - djd - Moved several rules out for new system
#		organization
# 20080809 - djd - Removed all system level rules as they are
#		now being handled by the Python scripts.
# 20080906 - djd - Took out the cleaning rules for source text
# 20080926 - djd - Added Wiki information management rules
# 20081004 - djd - Added project conf files editing rule
# 20090110 - djd - Added booklet binding
# 20091210 - djd - Reorganized and changed names of component
#		groups to be more consistant
# 20091211 - djd - Did more adjustments on the rules. Also, had
#		this file moved to the end of the include chain
#		because some rules in this file were dependent
#		on rules that had not been expanded yet.
# 20091223 - djd - Removed references to MAPS folder
# 20100507 - djd - Moved out rules for illustration creation
# 20100611 - djd - Added functions to share
# 20100615 - djd - Changed hard codded extions to vars
# 20100618 - djd - Added extra warning with zenity dialogs
#		to the clean up process.

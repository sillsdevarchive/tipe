====== Project Setup ======

This page covers initial project setup.

===== Source Text =====
The Source folder inside the language folder (ISO 639-3 lanaguage code) contains all the source text files for a given project. They are read-only files. No editing should be done on these files by the publishing specialist, only the author. However, the files in this folder do not have to actually reside in the folder. For some projects, the source text will be shared by a number of other publishing projects.


We need much more setup information written here...

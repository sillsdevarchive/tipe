################ Description/Documentation ##################
#############################################################

# This class will create a picture listing file for a
# Bible book being processed with the pdf2ptx macro set
# in XeTeX.

# History:
# 20080623 - djd - Initial draft
# 20080904 - djd - Changed to output .piclist file even if
#       there are no pictures to process. This solves
#       a dependency problem in makefile
# 20081023 - djd - Refactored due to changes in project.conf
# 20081030 - djd - Added total dependence on log_manager.
#       This script will not run without it because
#       it handles all the parameters it needs.
# 20081230 - djd - Changed over to work stand-alone instead
#       of through version control.
# 20090504 - djd - Added a filter for peripheral matter files
# 20091214 - djd - Added a check for missing lib info. If not
#       found then it is reported and the process is
#       halted.
# 20100414 - djd - Changed the way process works by adding a
#       lib data file and limiting the project file to
#       only containing caption and location info.
# 20100512 - djd - Changes to the caption copy process and
#       illustration handling. There is now linking
#       from a shared folder to the project.
# 20100616 - djd - Adjusted conf call due to conf file
#       reorg. Also removed tabs.

====== Specifications ======
Created Friday 02 October 2009

Documentation here outlines general descriptions components of a publishing process. For a description of the actual process refer to the [[Process]] page. This documentation is aimed at an update to the system due out in early 2010.


===== Objects =====
**Summary:** Objects have a hierarchy. At the highest level you have the //Project// object which encompasses the entire publishing project. Inside this we find one, and only one, Book. Also, at this level we have the Admin object which contains a number of administrative documents dealing with project management. There is also a Data object which contains data for other objects in the project. Inside the Book object is contained Groups. Inside those groups we find items. This diagram is a basic view of the relationships of the objects.

Next we will look at the components of each object, the relationship it has with other objects, and the tasks that can be performed on it by the system.
